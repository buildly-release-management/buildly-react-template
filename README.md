## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The web application was tested and built with the following versions:

- node v23.10.0 (or v16.13.0+)
- yarn v1.22.17 (or v1.17.3+)
- npm v10.9.2+
- npm v8.0.0+ (tested up to v10.9.2)

### Installing

First of all, you need to have a Buildly Core instance up and running locally.
Further detail about how to deploy Buildly Core locally, check its [documentation](https://buildly-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To install the application you need to download and install its dependencies, so you have to navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.development.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
API_URL=https://labs-api.buildly.io
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-oauth-client-id
OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_URL=https://labs-api.buildly.io/o/authorize/
OAUTH_TOKEN_URL=https://labs-api.buildly.io/o/token/
OAUTH_REVOKE_URL=https://labs-api.buildly.io/o/revoke_token/
OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
OAUTH_SCOPE=read write
PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=https://labs-api.buildly.io
RELEASE_SERVICE_URL=https://labs-api.buildly.io
PRODUCTION=false
```

### Building and Running

To build the project:

```bash
yarn run build
```

For production build:

```bash
yarn run build:prod
```

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

```bash
./scripts/start-dev.sh
```

This script will:
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Create a template `.env.development.local` if missing
- Install dependencies if needed
- Load environment variables
- Start the development server

**To serve built files** (for production testing):

```bash
yarn run serve
```

Note: The serve command serves files from the `dist` directory after building.

Your Buildly React Template will be running locally and listening to the port 3000, so you can access it via your browser typing this address: 127.0.0.1:3000

## Features

### Dashboard
The application includes a comprehensive dashboard that serves as the homepage for logged-in users. The dashboard provides:

- **Personalized greeting** with time-based salutations
- **Product overview cards** showing products the user has access to with current release progress
- **Task management** with separate columns for assigned Issues and Features
- **Feedback system** displaying comments that mention the user
- **Release timeline** showing upcoming releases with due date warnings
- **Profile-based views** with different content for Developer vs Product Team users

The dashboard automatically becomes the default landing page after user login and is accessible via the main navigation.

**Dashboard Access**: After logging in, you'll be automatically redirected to the dashboard at `/app/dashboard`

## Running the tests

To **run tests** using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/):

```bash
yarn run test
```

To run tests in production mode:

```bash
yarn run test:prod
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
yarn run test-coverage
```

You can also use the test script:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

## Scripts Directory

All shell scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory. See `scripts/README.md` for detailed documentation of available scripts including:

- `start-dev.sh` - Enhanced development server startup
- `test-deployment.sh` - Pre-deployment validation
- `run-tests.sh` - Comprehensive test runner
- `pre-push-check.sh` - Quality gate validation before pushing
- `deploy.sh` & `deploy-aws.sh` - Deployment scripts

### Quality Gates and Testing Enforcement

This repository enforces quality gates to maintain code standards:

**Automatic Pre-Push Validation:**
- ESLint checks (must pass with 0 warnings)
- Test suite execution (all tests must pass)
- Build verification (must compile successfully)
- Conventional commit message format

**Manual Validation:**
```bash
# Run full pre-push validation
./scripts/pre-push-check.sh

# Run comprehensive deployment tests
./scripts/test-deployment.sh
```

**Repository Protection:**
- All pushes automatically run quality checks
- Failed validation will reject the push
- Bypass only with `git push --no-verify` (not recommended)

**If Push is Rejected:**
1. Run `./scripts/pre-push-check.sh` to see specific failures
2. Fix linting: `yarn run lint --fix`
3. Fix tests: `yarn run test`
4. Verify build: `yarn run build`
5. Retry push after fixes

## Troubleshooting

### Push Rejected? Quality Gates Enforced! üõ°Ô∏è

**If your push is rejected with "remote rejected" or "fatal error in commit_refs":**

This repository enforces quality gates. Your push was rejected because code validation failed.

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# 1. See what's failing
./scripts/pre-push-check.sh

# 2. Fix the issues shown
yarn run lint --fix
yarn run test
yarn run build

# 3. Try pushing again
git push origin master
```

**üìñ Detailed Help:** See `devdocs/PUSH_REJECTION_GUIDE.md` for complete troubleshooting steps.

### Local Development Issues

If you encounter issues starting the development server:

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure you have a `.env.development.local` file with the required environment variables
2. **Node Version**: The application has been tested with Node.js v16.13.0+ and v23.10.0
3. **Clear Cache**: Try clearing node_modules and reinstalling:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock
   yarn install
   ```
4. **Build First**: If dev server fails, try building first:
   ```bash
   yarn run build
   yarn run serve
   ```

### Environment Setup

For local development, create a `.env.development.local` file in the project root with your configuration:

```bash
API_URL=https://labs-api.buildly.io/
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-oauth-client-id
OAUTH_TOKEN_URL=https://labs-api.buildly.io/token/
PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=https://labs-product.buildly.io/
RELEASE_SERVICE_URL=https://labs-release.buildly.io/
PRODUCTION=false
# ... other environment variables
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** Never commit actual API keys, tokens, or secrets to Git. Use placeholder values like `your-api-key` in template files.

## Security

### Environment Variables and Secrets

- **Never commit** actual API keys, tokens, or secrets to Git
- Use `.env.development.local` for local development (already in `.gitignore`)
- Use template files (`.env.development.local.template`, `environment.js.template`) with placeholder values
- The `start-dev.sh` script will generate environment files with placeholders that need to be manually updated
- For production deployment, set environment variables through your deployment platform

### Files Ignored by Git

- `.env.development.local` - Contains actual development secrets
- `public/environment.js` - Generated file with runtime configuration
- All files in `.gitignore` should never contain real secrets

## Troubleshooting

### Development Server Issues

If you encounter issues starting the development server:

1. **Check Node version**: Ensure you're using Node.js v16.13.0 or higher
2. **Clear cache**: Try clearing yarn/npm cache with `yarn cache clean` or `npm cache clean --force`
3. **Reinstall dependencies**: Delete `node_modules` and `yarn.lock`/`package-lock.json`, then run `yarn install`
4. **Environment variables**: Ensure your `.env.development.local` file is properly configured
5. **Port conflicts**: Make sure port 3000 is not in use by another application

### Build Issues

If the build fails:

1. **Check webpack version**: This project uses webpack 5.x
2. **Node memory**: For large builds, you may need to increase Node's memory limit:
   ```bash
   export NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=4096"
   ```
3. **Legacy OpenSSL**: If you encounter OpenSSL errors, the build scripts include `--openssl-legacy-provider` flag

### API Connection Issues

If the application can't connect to the API:

1. **CORS settings**: Ensure your Buildly Core instance allows requests from `localhost:3000`
2. **API URL**: Verify the `API_URL` environment variable points to your Buildly Core instance
3. **OAuth configuration**: Check that your OAuth client is properly configured in Buildly Core

## Deployment

To deploy Buildly React Template on live, you can either use our [Buildly React Template Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/buildly/buildly-react-template) from Docker Hub or build your own image and host it somewhere, so it can be used with your deployment platform and/or tool.

### Build Docker image

First you need to have the web app dependencies installed and the app initialized locally.
And then you need to build it as a production application executing the following command:

```
$ yarn run build:prod
```

Now, you just need to build a Docker image and host it somewhere. Further info about how to build images, check Docker's [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).
